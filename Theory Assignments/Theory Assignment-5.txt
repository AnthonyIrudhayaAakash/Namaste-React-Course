1)What is the difference between Named Export, Default export and * as export?

	->"Named Export" is used to export  multiple functions,components, variables from same file."Named Export" can be  done in two Ways.

		> 1st Way :Exporting in the line beginning itself 

		->Ex:		export const data_1=[...];
				export const data_2=[...];

		> 2nd Way : Exporting at the end of code utilities wrapped within "{}" curly braces

		>Ex:		export{data_1,data_2};


	->"default Export" is used to export a single component,function,variable.It is usually used to export Functional Component from 
	   a file using the keyword "default" followed by "export"

		>Ex:		export default RestaurentCards;

	->"*" as export is used to export the entire values in a module with single line of code here we can use Aliasing to name the 		   module;
		
		>Ex:export * as myExports from "./myModule";

2)What is the importance of config.js file?

	1) In the context of Development, We use lot of external files or media files like image,video are common to many files
	  in our project.To avoid using it with long line of code . We use to wrap these utilities within seperate folder as
	  "config" or "utils".It makes our codebase and project environment more cleaner and ease our process.

3)What are ReactHooks?

	->ReactHooks are utility functions which are used to have states within Functional Components which help us to 
	  provide State variable and it makes our UI components more dynamic.

4)Why do we need a useState Hook?


	->"useState" hook used to provide a state variable in our functional components which can make the variable more dynamic
	   to make our variable depends on data.Even We can do modification for using "let&var" variable but the UI components are
	   not rendered.
	
	->By using State Variable,When We update it, React re-renders the UI Components.It help us to keep our data layer and UI layer
	  sync with each other.

	->By Following method , The State Variable is created

		Ex: const {Name,setName} = useState(...);

	->Adding to that, We cannot update State variable as like normal JS variable , we have to use a function which is passed as 
	  second parameter in the destructured array .Here We used "setName" as that function.
